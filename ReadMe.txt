1.Reason For Choice: |
----------------------
    - I chose this website because it tells a lot about the person without using words to discribe him.
    - plus the design of the website is mesmerising and easy to navigate. 
---------------------
2.Major challenges: |
---------------------
    - on the home page, in the navigation part on the top-left corner, I wasn't able to remove the underline 
      on the anchor tags(links) as it would requiere the style attribute which is not allowed in this project.

    - I had to use the 'valign = "top"' tag inorder to make the navigation pane stick in the top left corner of
      the webpage. (Note!!, the 'valign' atribute is no longer used in hTML5.)

3.Lessons Learnt: |
-------------------
    - CSS is a really important styling tool that lets you have 100% control over how you want your website to
      look.
    - You might have noticed the rather unusual naming of my HTML files. But that is because I wanted the file
      name to be differen from the name that is displayed in the website itself, (to keep safe from hackers). 
      I did it based on your recommendation on our lab session.
